Most of debhelper config files like debian/*.dirs, debian/*.install,
debian/*.doc-base* are generated at build-time from the
debian/packages.d/$package.in files, which are in the following
format:
	%# comment
	%filename1%
	contents of filename1
	%filename2%
	%# another comment
	contents of filename2
At build-time the files will be installed as debian/$package.filename
