afterstep (1.6.10-1.1) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * Non-maintainer upload
  * Replace the obsoleted command "register-window-manager"
    with the new method using "update-alternatives" in
    the maintainer scripts. This is absolutely required for potato,
    because potato's xfree86-common no longer supports this obsolete
    command. Closes: #53689
  * Fix the bug "can not start xterm". Thanks to Cormac McGuinness
    for his report and the solution. Closes: #58261
  * The current version no longer conflicts with asclock, and
    the current potato system can have both of afterstep and wmaker
    without difficulties. Closes: #36043
  * The previous version (1.6.10-1) already used "--enable-i18n"
    option for the ./configure command in debian/rules. Closes: #38154
  * I can't reproduce this bug. I think the current version already
    fixes this bug at the upstream level. Closes: #22904
  * Fix debian/menu-methods to enable restart the other window manager.
  * Use /usr/share/doc/afterstep with the link to /usr/doc/afterstep.
  * Replace ${DATADIR}/afterstep/start/Modules/Scripts/2_desksetup
    with 2_pointersetup, because scripts/DeskSetup does not work, and
    do harm on asclassic's configuration file (~/.steprc).
    The newer version of afterstep will use the new control panel (ASCP)
    tool, and this scripts/DeskSetup is obsoleted anyway.

       up /Debian menu rather than upstream HotList menu). (Fixes Bug#9877)
     - Have Debian menus included after upstream menus so that the former
       can reference the later.  (for the "Exit" menu)
     - Commented out xsetroot in initialization so that users can change
       their background in .xsession or wherever and not have it clobbered.

afterstep (0.99pre2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Essentially re-"Debianized" afterstep from scratch using deb-make
    and complying with the new packaging standards.
  * Added backgrounds and sounds from upstream package to Debian binary
    package.
  * /usr/X11R6/bin/afterstep is now added to /etc/X11/window-managers
    courtesy of debmstd.
  * Made some changes to the standard system.steprc to make things work
    a little more smoothly out of the box.
  * Changed things so that the binaries look for system.steprc in
    /etc/X11/afterstep/system.steprc and removed link from
    /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/afterstep/system.steprc.
  * New upstream version.  This is really the upstream version 1.0pre2, but
    that version number would make it a later version than 1.0 by the Debian
    convention.  Many massive improvments including bugfixes, new Wharf
    functionality, and improved and more flexible visual appearance. See
    the upstream CHANGES file for more information.
  * Other miscellaneous changes.

    debian.README.  Updated upstream package author's e-mail address.
  * Removed INSTALL.gz from /usr/doc/afterstep, as it isn't useful if you
