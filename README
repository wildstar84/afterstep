This repository originated with the latest AfterStep source code taken 
from the official Debian repository for version 2.2.12-12, March 24, 2019.
($>apt-get source afterstep), which applied all 57 Debian patches to it, 
therefore this source-tree ALREADY has these patches applied to it!

The purpose of this repository is three-fold:

1)  Provide a much more recent source-tree that should actually build on 
a modern Debian-based system, and perhaps others, than seems to be 
available elsewhere on GitHub!

2)  Fix Debian bug#925498 (reported by me) caused by the most recent 
Debian patch (#57) so that it will both build AND include TrueType fonts 
(the freefont2 library).  To build without TrueType fonts, simply 
configure with "--with-ttf=no".

3)  To add all my own AfterStep patches to fix various annoyances, mostly 
involving use of the "ClickToFocus" "feel option".  I use ClickToFocus, 
having first learnt GUIs on M$-Windows-based systems and old habits die 
hard!  ("ClickToFocus" means that when you click on a window with the 
mouse, that window is moved on top of others and given the keyboard focus, 
as opposed to "FocusFollowsMouse" where when you move the mouse over 
another window, that window then gets focused).  I seem to recall that the  
original developer of AfterStep was a Unix/"FocusFollowsMouse guy" and 
therefore "ClickToFocus" did not get as much testing to catch these 
annoyances?  Anyway, if you really appreciate the simplicity, but 
elegant beauty of this old, lean, powerful and minutely-configurable 
window-manager, and / or just need it's "Wharf" dockapp swallower / 
launcher, but get annoyed by it's quirks when using "ClickToFocus" 
(like me), then download, build, and install it from here!  All other 
sources I am aware of on GitHub are many years old and it's no longer 
downloadable from the official website:  http://afterstep.org/, and 
Sasha's no longer developing it.

Anway, if you just want a good, up-to-date AfterStep source-tree to 
build but without my patches, simply download, do a:

$>find . -name "*.org" -print

Then copy each one over it's corresponding file (without that extension), 
and build a stock AfterStep in all it's original glory, warts and all!

See the file "README.org" for their actual README (which is very dated)!

Here's some notes on how I build:

$>git clone git://github.com/wildstar84/afterstep afterstep-2.2.12 ~/afterstep-src

$>export CFLAGS="-march=native -O2"

$>cd ~/afterstep-src

#THE "helpcommand" IS OPTIONAL FOR HANDLING MANPAGES FOR APPLICATIONS WHEN [HELP] FUNCTION CALLED:
#CHANGE "/usr/local/bin/aterm TO YOUR PREFERRED TERMINAL APP.
#FOR SOME STUPID REASON THIS IS NOT CONFIGURABLE, BUT MUST BE COMPILED IN TO WORK?!

$>./configure --prefix=/usr/local --enable-alsa

$>make -j2

You should get at least 1 warning (harmless):

$>CLOSE DOWN AfterStep/X (go to a console)

$>sudo make install

$>RESTART X, ENJOY AFTERSTEP!
